## Supported GNOME versions

This extension works on GNOME Shell 3.36+. The [metadata](https://github.com/Leleat/AltTab-Mod/blob/master/alttab-mod%40leleat-on-github/metadata.json#L5) file lists all _currently_ supported GNOME Shell versions. Generally, only the most recent GNOME Shell is supported. That means older releases may not include all features and bug fixes.

## Installation

You can install it via https://extensions.gnome.org. Alternatively (or if you want an up-to-date version), download / clone the repository and run the `scripts/build.sh` script with the `-i` flag.
